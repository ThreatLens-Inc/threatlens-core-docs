## 🚀 Key Features

| Agent | Role | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Master Orchestrator** | 🧠 Central Controller | Manages coordination across all AI agents, normalizes data, and triggers workflows. |
| **Threat Intelligence Collector** | 🌐 Data Ingestion | Aggregates IOC feeds, OSINT, deep/dark web sources, and sandbox reports. |
| **IOC Enrichment Specialist** | 🔎 Context Builder | Enriches IOCs with metadata, threat scores, passive DNS, WHOIS, and more. |
| **MITRE ATT&CK Analyst** | 🗺️ TTP Mapping | Correlates events with adversary behavior using ATT&CK, detects patterns and techniques. |
| **Response Playbook Generator** | ⚙️ Auto-Responder | Generates actionable SOAR-compatible playbooks and remediation steps. |

## 💡 Why ThreatLens?

- **Built-in LLM Agents** – AI-driven analysis, summarization, and anomaly detection
- **Cross-Tool Integration** – Works with Wazuh, Splunk, SentinelOne, Elastic, VirusTotal, ANY.RUN, and more
- **Modular & Scalable** – Deploy agents independently or as a unified suite
- **Privacy-First** – No raw data sent to external LLMs; in-house or API-secured model usage
- **Realtime Intelligence** – From IOC → IOA → TTP → IOB in one pipeline

## 🔗 Integrations

| Tool | Capability |
|------|------------|
| Wazuh | SIEM correlation, event forwarding |
| Splunk | Log ingestion, dashboard export |
| VirusTotal | File and domain enrichment |
| Hybrid Analysis / Joe Sandbox | Malware behavior analysis |
| MISP | Threat sharing & IOC correlation |
| Microsoft Sentinel | Cloud SIEM and SOAR |

## 🔍 Sample Query

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.thethreatlens.com/enrich      -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"      -d '{"ioc": "1.2.3.4"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ip": "1.2.3.4",
  "threat_score": 87,
  "geo": "RU",
  "related_hashes": [...],
  "mitre_ttp": "T1046",
  "sandbox_behavior": "C2 Beaconing"
}
```

## 🧠 Powered by LLMs

ThreatLens leverages private LLM APIs or your custom models to:
- Detect behavioral anomalies
- Summarize investigation trails
- Correlate across time windows
- Auto-generate incident narratives

---

## 📈 Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-tenant support for MSSPs
- [ ] SOC terminal dashboard (React + WebSockets)
- [ ] Agentless deployment for CNAPP module
- [ ] ThreatLens Mobile App (MVP in progress)
- [ ] Plugin SDK for third-party threat sources
